# Blank .NET MAUI Template

This is the same as the default .NET MAUI Hello World template, but without Shell.
    
The .NET MAUI template has been updated to use Shell by default. Shell is awesome, but not necessarily the right fit for every situation. It's trivial to remove it from the app that the template produces, but if you want a template that's already done this, then feel free to use this one.

## Usage

Install with:

`dotnet new --install Goldie.BlankMauiTemplate`

Generate a new .NET MAUI projecet with:

`dotnet new blankmaui`
